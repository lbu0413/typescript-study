Typescript was made by Microsoft in Oct, 2012
- open-source language
- any browser, any OS, anywhere Javascript runs
- superset of Javascript

JS = dynamically typed, prototype-based, class-like (ES6)
TS = statically typed, class, interface, generics, types (OOP)


TS -transcompiles-> JS
    *TS babel*


Why Typescript?
1. Type (Safe)
2. OOP (Object-Oriented-Programing)

programming -> Compile Time -> Runtime

- if type can be checked and decided during compile time, it is a statically typed programming language

- dynamically typed (easy, flexible, fast but dangerous)
    * no type at programming time and compile time
    * bad readability 

- OOP
    * modern programming paradigm
    * modularity, reusability, extensibility, maintainability
    * productivity, higher-quality, faster
